# üèÅ Final project üèÅ

## Description
During our 9-week bootcamp (DFEDATA6) held from 17th January 2022 to 18th March 2022, we learnt SQL, Python programming, big data and AI principles, analysing data with different libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn and scipy) and how to develop ML models in Azure ML Studio and with python scripting.

In this project, I will be analysing this [Stroke prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) available on Kaggle. For that purpose, I will be using the libraries mentioned above and will be exporting the clean data to do ML with the help of Azure ML Studio.

## Goals
1. To prove that I have learnt Python, can use the libraries mentioned above and prove myself that I can analyse data.
2. To continue learning - next step: ML with Python.

## Acknowledgements
Our coaches, particularly Shantanu Pandey, my classmates, my tech community in Milton Keynes and the global tech community for the amazing resources available online.

## Outcome
PASS
